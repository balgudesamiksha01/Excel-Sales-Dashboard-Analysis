🎯 Project Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze the 2022 sales data for a retail store called Vertex Market. This dashboard helps the business owner understand customer behavior, identify top-performing states, and analyze sales trends across different e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
Tool: Microsoft Excel (Advanced)

Features Used: Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, Data Validation, and Conditional Formatting.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
To ensure the accuracy of the dashboard, I performed the following steps:

Removing Duplicates: Cleaned the raw data to ensure each Order ID is unique.

Data Standardization: Used TRIM and Proper functions to fix naming inconsistencies in columns like 'Category' and 'Status'.

Handling Missing Values: Checked for null values in the 'Age' and 'Gender' columns to maintain data integrity.

Custom Columns: Created custom 'Age Group' categories (Adult, Senior, Teenager) using Excel formulas to get deeper demographic insights.

📈 Key Insights from the Dashboard
Gender Analysis: Women are the primary customers, contributing to nearly 64% of total sales.

Channel Performance: Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra are the top 3 channels, accounting for the majority of the orders.

Top State: Maharashtra emerged as the highest-selling state in 2022.

Age Group: The 'Adult' age group (30-49 yrs) is the most active segment, contributing significantly to the revenue.

🚀 How to use this Dashboard
